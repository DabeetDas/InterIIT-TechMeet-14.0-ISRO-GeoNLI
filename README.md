**TRINETRA**

TRINETRA is an AI-powered conversational platform designed for Geospatial Natural Language Interpretation (GeoNLI) across remote sensing imagery of multiple modalities, including optical, False Color Composite (FCC), and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). It supports three core tasks captioning, grounding, and visual question answering to deliver clear, context-aware insights directly tied to geospatial data. Alongside these core capabilities, TRINETRA offers AgriChat for agriculture specific queries and GEO Compare for temporal comparison, allowing users to analyze and interpret changes between two images of the same location over time.
